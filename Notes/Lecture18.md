# Introduction to Functional Programming

# Higher Order Functions
a function which takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a result is called a higher order function.

if we have to create a function each for calculating area, permiter and diameter of circle, then creating functions for each of them is a not good approach. it leads to code repetation. thats why we need to create a function which can take another function as an argument and return the result of that function.

DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself.

We can kind of say we wrote our implementation of map.
